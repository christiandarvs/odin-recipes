    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Breakfast Sandwiches - meal prep style! Bake up your eggs on a sheet pan with bacon and spinach, tuck them into english muffin with some cheese, and stash them in the freezer for the week. SO GOOD.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
            <li>a few handfuls of spinachs</li>
            <li>12 English Muffins</li>
            <li>Cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>Butter (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Generously oil a rimmed half sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces. Fry in a heavy skillet until crispy. Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Using tongs, let excess fat drip off for a few seconds before adding your bacon and spinach to the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the oiled half sheet pan (13″ x 18″). Bake for 15 minutes, until just set.</li>
        <li>Remove, cool, and cut into rounds using a wide mason jar lid or round cookie cutter. Spread English muffins with butter (optional) and place an egg round on each one. Add cheese, wrap in foil, and voila.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate (4-5 days) or freeze (no limit, lol). To reheat, you can use the oven, microwave, toaster oven, or some combination of all! See notes.</li>
